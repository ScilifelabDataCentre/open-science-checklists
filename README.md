# SciLifeLab Open Science Checklists
These checklists are developed by the Open Science Team at SciLifeLab Sweden, in collaboration with partner universities and subject matter experts (internal and external)*, to support compliance with the FAIR principles when publishing articles and software.

Please note that these checklists are in development and are <ins>intended to be guiding resources which do not require every item to be completed.</ins>

<sub>*Checklists have been reviewed and contributed to by the SciLifeLab _Seshat_, _Berserkers_, _RDM_, and _Freya_ teams, as well as Stockholm University and the Netherlands eScience Center.</sub>
