# Open Access Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide you in making informed decisions about publishing your research Open Access. It covers key steps for choosing the right Open Access route, applying appropriate licenses, and ensuring compliance with institutional and funder policies.
---

## CHOOSE AN OPEN ACCESS ROUTE 

- [ ] **Know the different open access publishing models and types:** 

* **Green Open Access:** Authors deposit a version of their work in a repository, making it freely accessible, often after an embargo period (delayed access before your work can be openly published). 
* **Gold Open Access:** Articles are published in open access journals or monographs, typically for a fee, Article Processing Charge (APC), and made immediately available. 
* **Diamond Open Access:** Journals and platforms are free for both authors and readers, removing financial barriers to access and publication, often supported by institutions or non-profits. 
* **Hybrid Open Access:** Subscription-based journals offering an option for authors to pay an APC to make individual articles open access. 
* **Bronze Open Access:** Articles are freely available but lack an open license, limiting reuse rights.
* **Preprint:** A manuscript shared publicly before peer review, typically in repositories like arXiv or bioRxiv. 
* **Postprint (Author Accepted Manuscript, AAM):** The peer-reviewed version before publisher formatting, often deposited in repositories under Green OA.

## DETERMINE A JOURNAL’S OPEN ACCESS POLICY
- [ ] **Use policy evaluation tools** such as the [DOAJ](), [Journal Checker](), or the [Open Policy Finder]() to find or evaluate open access journals. 
- [ ] **Or manually check journal policies** using resources like [Emory University Libraries’ Open Access Journals checklist](). 
___

## CHECK INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDER’S OPEN ACCESS POLICIES 

- [ ] **Check OA policies from funders and institutions** (e.g., [Swedish Research Council Horizon Europe]()), as they may have specific requirements for OA publishing and the related costs. Tools like [Open Policy Finder]() and [Journal Checker tool]() can be used for gathering information on publisher, institution and funder policies. Alternatively, find specific policies on your funders and institutions websites (e.g., Swedish universities [KI](), [KTH](), [SU]() and [UU]()).
- [ ] **Investigate APC funding**: Determine whether your local university provides funding for APCs or has agreements with journals that enable a better OA route. 
- [ ] **Check if your university has an institutional repository** (e.g., [DiVA]()) for Green OA deposits. 

___

## RETAIN YOUR RIGHTS AND SELECT A LICENSE 

- [ ] **Add a Rights Retention Statement (RRS) to your manuscript** (e.g., in the Acknowledgements section) to retain copyright and comply with funder or institutional open access policies. See an RRS example from the University of Melbourne Library.
- [ ] **Publish under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic License** ([CC BY 4.0]()) license to comply with most funder requirements and maximise reuse while ensuring attribution. CC BY 4.0 is among the most permissive licenses, unlike CC0, which does not require attribution. If you need a different license, use the Creative Commons [Choose a License]() to find the best fit for your work. 
- [ ] **Write an author addendum**. In Sweden/Europe, RRS is usually sufficient due to funder policies, but if the publisher agreement is restrictive, consider using an author addendum (e.g. [SPARC Author Addendum]()) to formally retain your rights. Check with your university 
library for local support. 

___

## ALIGN OPEN ACCESS PLANS WITH CO-AUTHORS

- [ ] **Agree on open access routes and APC funding** with all co-authors early to align on 
publishing strategy and comply with funder and institutional policies. 

___

## SHARE DATA/SOFTWARE, IMPROVE DISCOVERABILITY AND MEET COMPLIANCE 

- [ ] **Deposit underlying data and code in open repositories** (e.g., [SciLifeLab Data Repository](), [Zenodo]()). See our open data and software checklists for guidance. 

- [ ] **Enhance the discoverability** of your preprint by adding keywords, DOIs (via [Crossref]() or [DataCite]()), and links to help others find your work. 

- [ ] **Use persistent identifiers** like ORCID (authors), ROR (affiliations), DOIs (publications, datasets, software), RRIDs (research resources, and protocols) to improve tracking and impact. 
___

## ENGAGE WITH OPEN PEER REVIEW AND THE COMMUNITY 

- [ ] **Opt for open peer review**, if possible and the journal allows (e.g., [eLife](), [PREreview]()). 

- [ ] **Engage in post-publication discussions** (e.g., [Medium](), [PubPeer]()) to enhance transparency and impact. 

- [ ] **Promote your work** via [social media]() preprint communities, and research networks. 

___

## CHECK SHARING CONDITIONS AND SHARE YOUR WORK 

- [ ] **Verify which version of your paper can be shared** (preprint, accepted manuscript, or published version). 

- [ ] **Check for any embargo periods** (e.g., 6–24 months) before self-archiving. 

- [ ] **Upload your preprint** to a preprint repository such as [bioRxiv]() or [arXiv](). See a [full list of preprint servers] from [ASAPbio](). 

- [ ] **Deposit your accepted manuscript** in a university or disciplinary repository (e.g., [Europe PMC]). Or if you do not have one, try [shareyourpaper.org]().

_For more detailed policies, check with your university, funders, and specific journals. Avoid predatory publishers by verifying journals through trusted sources. Always ensure that your publishing choices align with funder and institutional requirements. Remember that open access is one aspect of open science - ensure early integration of data management plans, persistent identifiers, responsible authorship, and sharing of data, code, and protocols to support compliance, transparency, and to make your publication process easier._
