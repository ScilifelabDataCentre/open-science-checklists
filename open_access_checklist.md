# Open Access Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide you in making informed decisions about publishing your research as openly as possible.
It covers key steps for choosing the right Open Access route, applying appropriate licences, and ensuring compliance with institutional and funder policies.

---

## CHOOSE AN OPEN ACCESS ROUTE

Publishing open access means your paper is freely accessible, but there are several routes with differing degrees of openness. Below is a summary of the main publishing models, ordered from most to least aligned with open science principles:

* **Diamond Open Access:** Articles are made freely available immediately, with no fees for authors or readers. Costs are covered by institutions, libraries, or public organisations.
* **Gold Open Access:** Articles are made freely available immediately upon publication. A publication fee, known as an Article Processing Charge (APC), is usually paid by the author, their institution, or funder to cover publishing costs.
* **Green Open Access:** Authors deposit a version of their work in a repository, making it freely accessible, often after an embargo period (a waiting time set by the publisher or journal before the article can be shared openly).
* **Hybrid Open Access:** Articles are published in subscription-based journals, but authors can choose to pay an APC to make their individual article open access.

In addition to your peer-reviewed final publication, you can also share a preprint, which is a version of your manuscript made publicly available before peer review, typically in repositories like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/).



>***To evaluate open access journals, use policy evaluation tools such as the [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/), [Journal Checker](https://journalcheckertool.org/), or the [Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/). 
For information about open access publishing agreements available to researchers affiliated with Swedish institutions, consult the [Open Access in Bibsam Agre­e­ments page](https://www.kb.se/samverkan-och-utveckling/oppen-tillgang-och-bibsamkonsortiet/open-access-and-bibsam-consortium/bibsam-consortium/open-access-in-bibsam-agreements.html) produced by the National Library of Sweden.***

## CHECK INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDER’S OPEN ACCESS POLICIES

- [ ] **Check OA policies from funders and institutions** (e.g., [Swedish Research Council Horizon Europe](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/publishing-open-access.html)), as they may have specific requirements for OA publishing and the related costs. Tools like [Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/) and [Journal Checker tool](https://journalcheckertool.org/) can be used for gathering information on publisher, institution and funder policies. Alternatively, find specific policies on your funder's and institution's websites. Find a summary of policies for SciLifeLab affiliated universities on the SciLifeLab RDM Guidelines webpage: [University RDM resources](https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/topics/university-rdm-resources/).
- [ ] **Investigate APC funding**: Determine whether your local university provides funding for APCs or has agreements with journals that reduce, or remove APC costs. (Example: Uppsala University provides a [tool to search for the journals](https://search.scifree.se/uu) included in their open access agreements).
- [ ] **Check if your university has an institutional repository** (e.g., [DiVA](https://www.diva-portal.org/)) for Green OA deposits.

---

## RETAIN YOUR RIGHTS AND SELECT A LICENCE
- [ ] **Choose a license for your publications, data, and creative works** using the [Creative Commons 'Choose a License'](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) tool.
- [ ] **Choose a license for your software or code** using the [Choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/) tool to select a suitable open source license such as MIT, Apache, or GPL.

**For publishing routes other than Diamond or Gold, and for collaborations with organisations outside Sweden:**

- [ ] **Add a Rights Retention Statement (RRS) to your manuscript** to retain the right to share your peer-reviewed research openly without embargo and to comply with funder or institutional open access policies. See an [example RRS from the University of Melbourne Library](https://library.unimelb.edu.au/open-scholarship/rights-retention).


- [ ] **Use an author addendum, if needed**. In most cases within Sweden/Europe, an RRS is sufficient due to funder policies. However, if the publisher’s agreement is restrictive, or you are collaborating with authors outside of these regions, consider attaching an author addendum (e.g., [SPARC Author Addendum](https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights/)) to ensure you retain your rights. Contact your university library for assistance.


---
## ENSURE YOUR WORK IS CITABLE AND FINDABLE 
- [ ] **Provide descriptive metadata** which includes essential details such as title, authors, version, licence, keywords and DOI.
- [ ] **Ensure proper credit** by identifying all contributors early, record their roles, and link their [ORCID iDs](https://orcid.org/) to ensure they are properly credited in citations and records. Use formats such as a `CITATION.cff`, a contributors table in your `README.md` (e.g., [The Turing Way's Contributors Table](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/acknowledgement/acknowledgement-record)), or frameworks like [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) to structure this information.
- [ ] **Use persistent identifiers** like [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) (authors), [ROR](https://ror.org/) (affiliations), [DOIs](https://www.doi.org/) (publications, datasets, software), [RRIDs](https://www.rrids.org/) (research resources, and protocols) to improve tracking and impact.

---

## SHARE DATA AND SOFTWARE
- [ ] **Create a Data Management Plan (DMP)** to outline how data will be collected, stored, shared, and preserved. 
- [ ] **Create a Software Management Plan (SMP)** which outlines contributors, project name, versioning, coding standards, dependencies, testing, and sustainability. Use the Software Sustainability Institute's [SMP guide and template](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/software-management-plans), Netherlands eScience Centers [Practical Guide to SMPs](https://zenodo.org/records/7589725) or the [Software Management Wizard (SMW)](https://smw.dsw.elixir-europe.org/wizard/) to create one. See our [SciLifeLab Open Science Software Checklist](https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.29086775.v1) for guidance.
- [ ] **Deposit  data and code in open repositories** (e.g., [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://figshare.scilifelab.se/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).  If you are publishing data or creative works on the SciLifeLab Data Repository, follow the [SciLifeLab Data Repository Submission Guidelines](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/#authors).
- [ ] **Reference your data and software** with a clear data availability statement so others can find, access, and reuse it. The [AGU Templates](https://www.agu.org/publications/authors/journals/data-software-for-authors) provide a resource of what should be included in an availability statement.

---

## CHECK SHARING CONDITIONS AND SHARE YOUR WORK

- [ ] **Check which version of your paper you can share**, such as the preprint, the accepted manuscript (Author Accepted Manuscript), or the final published version.

- [ ] **Check embargo periods** (e.g., 6–24 months) before uploading your article to a repository.

- [ ] **Upload your preprint** to a preprint repository such as [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). See a full [list of preprint servers from ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers).

- [ ] **Deposit your accepted manuscript** in a university or disciplinary repository (e.g., [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/)). If your institution doesn't have one, try [shareyourpaper.org](http://shareyourpaper.org/).
- [ ] **Link all your research outputs to your ORCiD** to increase the discoverability of your research. 

---
## ENGAGE WITH OPEN PEER REVIEW AND THE COMMUNITY

- [ ] **Choose open peer review**, if possible and the journal allows (e.g., [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/), [PREreview](https://prereview.org/)), to increase transparency in the review process.

- [ ] **Engage in post-publication discussions** (e.g., [Medium](https://medium.com/), [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/)) to share insights and respond to feedback.

- [ ] **Promote your work** via [social media](https://www.pnas.org/post/update/promoting-your-scholarly-research-social-media) preprint communities, and research networks.
