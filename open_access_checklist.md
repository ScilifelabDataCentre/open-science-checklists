# Open Access Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide you in making informed decisions about publishing your research as openly as possible.
It covers key steps for choosing the right Open Access route, applying appropriate licences, and ensuring compliance with institutional and funder policies.

---

## CHOOSE AN OPEN ACCESS ROUTE

Publishing open access means your paper is freely accessible, but there are several routes with differing degrees of openness. Below is a summary of the main publishing models, ordered from most to least aligned with open science principles:

* **Diamond Open Access:** Articles are published fully open with no fees for authors or readers, funded by institutions or public organisations.
* **Gold Open Access:** Articles are published open immediately, with a reuse licence, usually funded by the author or organisation through a publication fee.
* **Green Open Access:** Authors deposit a version of their work in a repository, making it freely accessible, often after an embargo period (a waiting time set by the publisher or journal before the article can be shared openly).
* **Hybrid Open Access:** Subscription-based journals offering an option for authors to pay an article processing charge (APC) to make individual articles open access.

In addition to your peer-reviewed final publication, you can also share a preprint, which is a version of your manuscript made publicly available before peer review, typically in repositories like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/).



>***To evaluate open access journals, use policy evaluation tools such as the [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/), [Journal Checker](https://journalcheckertool.org/), or the [Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/). 
For information about open access publishing agreements available to researchers affiliated with Swedish institutions, consult the [Open Access in Bibsam Agre­e­ments page](https://www.kb.se/samverkan-och-utveckling/oppen-tillgang-och-bibsamkonsortiet/open-access-and-bibsam-consortium/bibsam-consortium/open-access-in-bibsam-agreements.html) produced by the National Library of Sweden.***

## CHECK INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDER’S OPEN ACCESS POLICIES

- [ ] **Check OA policies from funders and institutions** (e.g., [Swedish Research Council Horizon Europe](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/publishing-open-access.html)), as they may have specific requirements for OA publishing and the related costs. Tools like [Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/) and [Journal Checker tool](https://journalcheckertool.org/) can be used for gathering information on publisher, institution and funder policies. Alternatively, find specific policies on your funder's and institution's websites. Find a summary of policies for SciLifeLab affiliated universities on the SciLifeLab RDM Guidelines webpage: [University RDM resources](https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/topics/university-rdm-resources/).
- [ ] **Investigate APC funding**: Determine whether your local university provides funding for APCs or has agreements with journals that enable a better OA route. (Example: Uppsala University provides a [tool to search for the journals](https://search.scifree.se/uu) included in their open access agreements).
- [ ] **Check if your university has an institutional repository** (e.g., [DiVA](https://www.diva-portal.org/)) for Green OA deposits.

## RETAIN YOUR RIGHTS AND SELECT A LICENCE
**For all publishing routes:**
- [ ] **Publish under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic License** ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)) to comply with most funder requirements and maximise reuse while ensuring attribution. CC BY 4.0 is among the most permissive licences, unlike CC0, which does not require attribution. If you need a different licence, use the Creative Commons [Choose a License](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) to find the best fit for your work.

**For Green, Bronze and Hybrid publishing routes:**

- [ ] **Add a Rights Retention Statement (RRS) to your manuscript** to retain the right to share your peer-reviewed research openly without embargo and to comply with funder or institutional open access policies. See an [example RRS from the University of Melbourne Library](https://library.unimelb.edu.au/open-scholarship/rights-retention).


- [ ] **If needed, use an author addendum**. In most cases within Sweden/Europe, an RRS is sufficient due to funder policies. However, if the publisher’s agreement is restrictive, or you are collaborating with authors outside of these regions, consider attaching an author addendum (e.g., [SPARC Author Addendum](https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights/)) to ensure you retain your rights. Contact your university library for assistance.


---

## ALIGN OPEN ACCESS PLANS WITH CO-AUTHORS

- [ ] **Agree on open access routes and APC funding** with all co-authors early to align on publishing strategy and comply with funder and institutional policies.

---

## SHARE DATA/SOFTWARE, IMPROVE DISCOVERABILITY AND MEET COMPLIANCE

- [ ] **Deposit underlying data and code in open repositories** (e.g., [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://figshare.scilifelab.se/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)). See our [SciLifeLab Open Science Software Checklist](https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.29086775.v1) for guidance.

- [ ] **Enhance the discoverability** of your preprint by adding keywords, DOIs (via [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) or [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)), and links to help others find your work.

- [ ] **Use persistent identifiers** like [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) (authors), [ROR](https://ror.org/) (affiliations), [DOIs](https://www.doi.org/) (publications, datasets, software), [RRIDs](https://www.rrids.org/) (research resources, and protocols) to improve tracking and impact.

---

## ENGAGE WITH OPEN PEER REVIEW AND THE COMMUNITY

- [ ] **Opt for open peer review**, if possible and the journal allows (e.g., [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/), [PREreview](https://prereview.org/)).

- [ ] **Engage in post-publication discussions** (e.g., [Medium](https://medium.com/), [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/)) to enhance transparency and impact.

- [ ] **Promote your work** via [social media](https://www.pnas.org/post/update/promoting-your-scholarly-research-social-media) preprint communities, and research networks.

---

## CHECK SHARING CONDITIONS AND SHARE YOUR WORK

- [ ] **Verify which version of your paper can be shared** (preprint, accepted manuscript, or published version).

- [ ] **Check for any embargo periods** (e.g., 6–24 months) before self-archiving.

- [ ] **Upload your preprint** to a preprint repository such as [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). See a full [list of preprint servers](https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers) from [ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/).

- [ ] **Deposit your accepted manuscript** in a university or disciplinary repository (e.g., [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/)). Or if you do not have one, try [shareyourpaper.org](http://shareyourpaper.org/).
- [ ] **Link all your research outputs to ORCiD** to increase the discoverability of your research.

_For more detailed policies, check with your university, funders, and specific journals. Avoid predatory publishers by verifying journals through trusted sources. Always ensure that your publishing choices align with funder and institutional requirements. Remember that open access is one aspect of open science - ensure early integration of data management plans, persistent identifiers, responsible authorship, and sharing of data, code, and protocols to support compliance, transparency, and to make your publication process easier._
